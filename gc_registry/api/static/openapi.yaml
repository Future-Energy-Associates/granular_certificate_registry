  description: "\nThis document outlines the EnergyTag API Specification to accompany\
    \ Version 2 of \nthe EnergyTag Standard.\nThe functionality outlined within each\
    \ API interaction represents the recommended \nminimum required detail necessary\
    \ to implement a consistent Granular Certificate \n(GC) registry system. \nWithin\
    \ the Certificates section, the definition of GCs as specified in the Create \n\
    Certificate POST request, alongside the filtering parameters required to instigate\
    \ \nquery, transfer, and cancellation requests, will form core components of the\
    \ standard \nand impact the functionality of the registry the greatest. Subsequent\
    \ sections \ndescribing Organisation, User, Account, and Device management are\
    \ **recommendations \nonly** and do not form part of the standard, although terminology\
    \ used therein is \nreferenced in the certificate definitions. They are included\
    \ in the database class \ndiagram for the sake of completeness in representing\
    \ the relationships between the \ncertificate and action definitions; the fields\
    \ implemented for these tables are \nleft to the discretion of the registry operator.\
    \ \n<br>\n\nWhere Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) have been used, these\
    \ can be replaced with \nany consistent and unique identification mechanism preferred\
    \ by the registry; for \nexample, concatenations of datetime and Device ID). It\
    \ is recommended that GC Bundle \nIDs remain represented as integers, or an initial\
    \ string concatenated with an integer, \nthat can be both uniquely referenced\
    \ and unambiguously incremented to simplify the \nGC Bundle subdivision process.\n\
    <br>\n \nEach API call defined below is to be interpreted as an instance of an\
    \ object that is \nstored by the registry upon receipt by a User, and can be updated\
    \ as it moves from \nreceived, through pending, to resolved within a transaction\
    \ log uniquely identified\nby an action ID. With this in mind, fields such as\
    \ `action_completed_datetime` are \nnot to be interpreted as attributes supplied\
    \ by the User, but fields that are \npopulated and updated by the registry as\
    \ the request is processed. \nThis approach allows any and all actions to be queried\
    \ and traced, with relevant \nUser access rights left to the discretion of the\
    \ registry operator. \n<br>\n\n[Click here](https://pasteboard.co/KHFQcxYCoRPL.png)\

    \ processes.\n\n"

- description: "The Storage Charge Record (SCR) is a record of the energy charged\
    \ into a Storage Device from the grid or directly from another energy source.\n\
    All charging events must be recorded in an SCR following verification of metering\
    \ reports from the storage unit.\nOnce recorded, an SCR can be allocated to a\
    \ cancelled GC bundle issued in the same time period as the charging interval,\n\
    retaining the attributes of the GCs representing the energy charged. The Registry\
    \ must ensure that a\nprocess is in place to verify that the energy charged into\
    \ the Storage Device is not double-counted or mismatched to the wrong\nnumber\
    \ of cancelled GC Bundles, and that the cancelled GC Bundles were issued within\
    \ the charging interval indicated in the SCR.\n<br>\n\nA suggested approach to\
    \ applying this requirement is to enforce a one-to-one relationship between SCRs\
    \ and the cancelled GC Bundles,\nallowing the full set of GC Bundle attributes\
    \ to be referenced from the SCR and the subsequent SDR/SD-GC Bundle as a\nsingle\
    \ dependent chain without needing any aggregation or weighting algorithms. A disadvantage\
    \ of this approach is that only a single \ncontiguous range of GC Bundle IDs can\
    \ be allocated to each SCR, which in practice may lead to a large number of SCRs\
    \ created due to \nmultiple non-contiguous GC Bundles being allocated in the same\
    \ charging interval. More details can be found in the White Paper.\n<br>\n\nThe\
    \ Storage Discharge Record (SDR) is a record of the energy discharged by a Storage\
    \ Device into the grid.\nIt is issued following the verification of a cancelled\
    \ GC Bundle, a matching allocated SCR, and the proper allocation\nof Storage Losses\
    \ incurred during the charge interval. It is recommended that the methodology\
    \ with which Storage Device \noperators are permitted to allocate SDRs to SCRs,\
    \ whether LIFO, FIFO, a weighted average, or operator's discretion, is\nfixed\
    \ such that operators cannot change the methodology in a way that would allow\
    \ them to manipulate the allocation of SDRs.\n<br>\n\nTo comply with the Standard,\
    \ the Registry must provide a process to view the attributes of the underlying\
    \ GC Bundles that\nhave been cancelled leading to the issuance of the SCR allocated\
    \ to this SDR, by following the chain of one-to-one foreign\nkeys from the SDR\
    \ to the SCR, and from the SCR to the cancelled GC Bundles.\n<br>\n\nThe method\
    \ for calulating the storage loss is not mandated, but the Registry must ensure\
    \ that the method used is transparent and\nclearly documented for auditing purposes.\
    \ The method proposed in this API Specification followed the suggested methodology\
    \ in the\nEnergyTag Standard, which is to calculate the storage losses as the\
    \ difference between the total input and output energy\nof the Storage Device\
    \ over a specified interval period (which shall not exceed 6 months for the initial\
    \ efficiency factor\ncalculated from the start-up date of the Storage Device),\
    \ implicitly including parasitic losses."
